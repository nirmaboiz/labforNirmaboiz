      "  Product arrived a couple of days early 👌. The phone is new and sturdy. Turned it on but didn't take me  through the usual setup process I am used to with other phones bought in the past. The phone came on with a foreign language which I later found out to be Thai. I couldn't default it to English without the help of a friend to do that with much challenge... reason for the 4 star. When I thought it was all said and done, the internet browser brought up the Thai language again. Realized the URL directed me to Thai site, changed that to a familiar one and it was now in English. The browser seems to remember the last URL even when deactivated and reactivated so didn't have the Thai Language problem again. The phone has password, facial and finger print security features. I opted for the fingerprint security feature (password is a required option) and found it to be work real well. It also has 2 dedicated SIM card slots and a micro SD slot unlike some that uses one of the SIM card slots optionally for the micro SD card. Plan to use the phone for my international travels so I am yet to test all the appropriate functionalities of the phone having received it only yesterday. Therefore I can't grade the battery life yet.\n",

Besides that and the fact I had to return this totally awesome phone (hassle free)because of my minute plan,it is a pretty cool phone,and the cameras,well that is why I bought it in the first place ,they all worked great. I will be looking for this model that will work with my minute plan. I liked the feel of the phone and ease of setting it up. Worth the money IF it will work with your minute plan.\n",
